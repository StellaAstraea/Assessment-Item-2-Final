# Assessment-Item-2-Final

This is an old HTML 5/CSS/Javascript, University project based on planning and creating a functional website that could be viewed. 
The final result is weak but functional, with little detail but serving as a foundation of the knowledge I learnt about HTML, CSS and Javasript in my first year.
